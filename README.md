# ethanol
An experimental environment for context-based flow artifact analysis. It implements two phases:
* building a context for the specified object using the set of predefined rules and ML-based models
* performing various analysis by custom analytical procedures

## Environment and Packages 

## Usage

## Why?

## Documentation
The system is used to analyse the data source, e.g., NetFlow collection that provides an input data. For the selected object, its context 
is created and then analyzed. Using this approach it is possible to either provide a rich information for each object or to perfom advanced
security threats identification or network troubleshooting.
