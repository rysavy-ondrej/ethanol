# Detection of VPN

This playbook is about context-based detection of TOR/VPN traffic.

For some informaiton on Tor: https://ipdata.co/blog/tor-detection/

The idea of detection is that TOR/VPN traffic has always a single destination service. It means that there will be many connections to this endpoint (Tor exit node) that othewrise would be done to different nodes. 

Thus we need to aggregate these flows and analyze their parameters.
